TITLE
--------------
PGM. Probabilistic Graphical Models.


AUTHOR
--------------
Arturo Alatriste Trujillo.

DATE
--------------
2014 - Oct - 14


DESCRIPTION
--------------
PGM will be a software application coded in java for handling PGM. 



JUSTIFICATION
--------------

* This software and documentation is created for learning porpouses (for author and users) and explore PGMs and Java.

* Understand Hiden Markov chains (HMC).

* Have a platform Independent Engine that will be used in other applications for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 
  with OpenCV applications.  





GENERAL OBJECTIVE
----------------------
Create a software application for handling PGMs.





SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
----------------------


	* an application, with friendly GUI, so the user can create PGM and execute operations easily. 

	* an Engine for Prababilistic Graphical Models, such as Bayes Networks and Markov Chains.

	* application and java must be platform independet. They must run on Linux, Windows, etc.

	* programming language must be java

	* user documentation, how to use the application and engine.

	* PGM Tutorial, short and straight to Probability Foundations, how to do calculations, solve exercises by hand 
          and with the software application.

	* Be able to do some other operations with Random Variables, Probability Distributionss and Factors.

	


enjoy it!
